# FEDI3 Governance

## Stewardship

FEDI3 is stewarded by RedHunt07 as the reference implementation.
This does not imply ownership of the network.

## Network Integrity

The network must remain:

- Interoperable
- Decentralized
- Protocol-consistent

Forks that intentionally isolate themselves from the network are discouraged.

## Protocol Evolution

Protocol changes must:

- Be documented
- Be versioned
- Prefer backward compatibility

The protocol is a public social contract.

## Security updates

- Vulnerabilità critiche hanno priorità.
- Fix e advisory devono essere pubblici.

## Decision Model

Technical decisions are guided by:

- Security
- Privacy
- Decentralization
- Interoperability

Popularity alone is not a valid argument.
