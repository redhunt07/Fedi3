# FEDI3 Fork Policy

Forks are welcome.

Forks that intentionally break network compatibility without technical necessity are discouraged.

Forks may:

- Change UI
- Add features
- Improve performance
- Customize behavior

Forks should not:

- Introduce tracking
- Introduce ads
- Lock users into closed ecosystems

Forks must not claim to be official FEDI3 unless explicitly approved.

Compatibility is a responsibility.

Naming: evitare marchi o nomi che possano confondere gli utenti.
